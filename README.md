This repository is for my anomaly detection exercises and notes

### Anomaly 
    - Anomalies are the unusual, unexpected, surprising patterns in the observed world. An anomalous data point is a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as normal; an outlier. An anomaly is any event or measurement that is out of the ordinary regardless of whether it is exceptional or not.

### Outlier
    - An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations
